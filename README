picUnit is a unit testing framework to be used with PICkit2 and the microcontroller PIC16F690

Howto use picUnit

1. Write tests (see add2 example tests)
2. Create a makefile to build your application with your tests and picUnit. The makefile can be based on the makefile used in the add2 example.
3. Build tests
4. Run tests
4a. To run tests compiled for gcc you simply execute the out file
4b. To run tests compiled for PIC16F690 you need the command line tool pk2cmd
5. Put test results into text file
5a. For GCC you simply pipe the output from the test program into a textfile
5b. For PIC you have to use pk2cmd to read the EEPROM of the PIC16F90 and save to a textfile
6. Use python scipt to generate xml report compatible with Jenkins from textfile with results

Limitations
- Test case ends when first assert fails
- No fixtures
- Not possible to see on what line the assert failed
- 64 is the maximum amount of tests
